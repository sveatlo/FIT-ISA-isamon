# ISAMon

## Project description
Simple TCP/UDP network scanner created as a project assignment of the ISA course.

## Usage
isamon can scan local and non-local networks for live hosts and than perform a TCP/UDP port scan

### Parameters
Using:
 * -h will print help
 * -i <name> will use this interface in all scans
 * -t will perform a TCP scan on all live hosts
 * -u will perform a UDP scan on all live hosts
 * -p <port> will scan this port (can be used multiple times)
 * -n <subnet/netmask> will scan this network (can be combined with -i)
 * -w <time> will wait a max <time> ms before moving on. Default for ARP scan is 1s, for ICMP 2s, for TCP 1s, for UDP 1.1s per host

### Exit codes
On successfull exit, isamon returns 0 and no error message is written out.
In case isamon encounters an error, a non-zero error code is returned and an error message is written to stderr. Table of possible exit codes is below.
